Theory Questions:

Question 1. What is SQL, and why is it essential in database management?

Answer 1: SQL stands for Structured Query Language, Its a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.

This programming language is primarily used to communicate with relational databases. 
With SQL's help, we can access, retrieve, sort, and update information. 
It's used with well-known relational database management systems (RDBMS), including:

Oracle
Microsoft SQL Server
PostgreSQL
MySQL
MariaDB
SQLite

Question 2. Explain the difference between DBMS and RDBMS.

Answer 2: The main difference between a DBMS (Database Management System) and an RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) is that RDBMS is a type of DBMS that uses a relational model to store data in tables with relationships, while DBMS is a broader category that encompasses various data management systems, including those that may not use a relational model

Here's a more detailed breakdown:
DBMS (Database Management System):
Definition:
A software application used to create, manage, and interact with databases. 
Data Storage:
Can use various data models and storage formats, including hierarchical, network, or object-oriented models. 
Data Relationships:
May or may not support relationships between data elements. 
Examples:
Some examples of DBMS include file-based systems or older database systems that do not use a relational model. 

RDBMS (Relational Database Management System):
Definition:
A specific type of DBMS that uses a relational model to store data in tables, with rows and columns, and enforces relationships between data elements. 
Data Storage:
Stores data in tables, where each row represents a record and each column represents an attribute. 
Data Relationships:
Relational databases use keys and relationships to link data across tables, ensuring data integrity and consistency. 
Data Integrity:
Enforces data integrity through constraints and normalization, reducing redundancy and ensuring data accuracy. 
Query Language:
Typically uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for data manipulation and retrieval. 
Examples:
Popular RDBMS include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. 

Question 3. Describe the role of SQL in managing relational databases.

Answer3: SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for managing and interacting with relational databases, enabling tasks like data definition, manipulation, retrieval, and access control. 
Here's a more detailed explanation of SQL's role:
1. Data Definition:
Creating Databases and Tables:
SQL allows you to define the structure of your database, including creating databases themselves and defining tables with specific columns and data types. 
Defining Relationships:
You can use SQL to establish relationships between tables using primary and foreign keys, ensuring data integrity and consistency. 
2. Data Manipulation:
Inserting Data: SQL provides statements like INSERT to add new data into tables.
Updating Data: The UPDATE statement allows you to modify existing data within tables.
Deleting Data: The DELETE statement removes data from tables. 
3. Data Retrieval:
Querying Data:
The core strength of SQL is its ability to retrieve data using SELECT statements, allowing you to filter, sort, and aggregate data from one or more tables. 
Joining Tables:
SQL enables you to combine data from multiple tables using JOIN statements, allowing you to retrieve related information. 
4. Access Control:
Granting Permissions:
SQL allows you to control which users have access to specific tables or operations, enhancing data security. 
Defining Roles:
You can create roles with specific permissions, making it easier to manage user access. 
5. Other Functions:
Creating Views: SQL allows you to create virtual tables (views) that simplify complex queries or restrict access to specific data. 
Defining Stored Procedures: You can create reusable blocks of SQL code (stored procedures) to perform common tasks. 
Managing Indexes: SQL allows you to create indexes to improve the performance of queries.
